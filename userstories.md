#Bus Mall User Stories

* As a developer I want to create an app that will accurately track the number of times a user clicks on certain images as well as the percentage that an image was clicked when it was on screen.

* As a user I want to be able to track the most appealing products to keep in stock for future sales and to know which products are not as popular so I can discontinue them.

* As a developer I would like to create an app that is appealing for users to interact with for an enjoyable experience.

* As a developer I would like to notify the users of when they are able to review their results of the survey.

* As a user I would like a more interactive experience that tells me what is expected of me for the survey, how many images are left until I can view my results, a notice that I have completed all of the images and can view my results etc.
